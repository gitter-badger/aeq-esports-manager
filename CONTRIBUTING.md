### Submitting an Issue

Before submitting an issue, please check the archive for any related issues which may already answer your question. Duplicated issues slow down active development. Also, please open an new issue for each bug, proposal or feature request. 

Every issue should contain the following information, to resolve the problem as quicky as possible.
* **Overview of the Issue** - if an error is being thrown try to explain what you did; also, any non-minified stack traces may help
* **Version** - the version/release you are using
* **Browsers** and Operating System - which browser and operating system do you use?
* **Reproduce the Error** - can the error be reproduced?
* **Screenshots** - screenshots can help to understand the issue more quickly than a text descrption
